# Week 2 Linear Model intro

## The Modeling Process
1. State the question/hypothesis
    1. What is the question? 
    2. What are the variables (response and explanatory)?
3. Data Exploration 
4. Describe the Model
    4.  In word form (Should come from your question)
    4. In mathematical form
    4. Identify the assumptions of the model
6. Fit the model
7. Evaluate the output 
    7. Model validation
    7. Model selection
9. Interpret the results

### Lets start with Step 3

Linear models are the basis for many analytical methods. 
There are two fundamental components:
* <span style="color:blue"> Deterministic </span>(signal) - the "expected" value of the response given x
* <span style="color:grey"> Stochastic </span> (noise; residuals) - the difference between the "observed" value of the response and the expected

$$ y_i~ = ß_o + ß_1X_i + e_i $$

### <span style ="color:blue"> Deterministic </span> 
ß~o~ and ß~1~ are paramters to be estimated
When X is a factor (Means= <span style ="color:blue"> --- </span> <span style ="color:green"> --- </span> )

y~i~ = <span style="color:blue"> ß~o~</span>+ <span style= "color:green">ß~1~X~i~ </span> + e~i~
